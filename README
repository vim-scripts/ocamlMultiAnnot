This plugin is an improvement of the official ocaml ftplugin.

It corrects the 2 following bugs:
    - If nowrapscan is set, as annot file was not always read from beginning, we could not find result for information between the beginning of file and cursor position.
    - In splitted view, when we were reloading the .annot file, it was closing one of the splitted view.

New functionnality:
If we work with several ocaml .ml files, annotation are loaded for every file and so we can use those annotation for every buffer.

Added with version 1.1:
In addition to printing the type with <LocalLeader>t, save the type in the unnamed register, in order to copy/use it more easily.

I have tested this pugin on my own computer during a few weeks without bugs, please feel free to report bugs.

The plugin is essentially based on the official ocaml ftplugin, I would like to thanks:
David Baelde

Vincent Aravantinos
and others contributors to ocaml vim integration.
